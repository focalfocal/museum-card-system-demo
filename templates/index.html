            <h2>CARD SYSTEM DEMO FOR A HOLOCAUST THEMED MUSEUM</h2>
            <br/>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>This site simulates a card system in use on the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles (<a href = 'http://www.museumoftolerance.com'>http://www.museumoftolerance.com</a>) , for the exhibit on the Holocaust. Every visitor is given a card with the name and photo of a Jew child and as the visitor advances on the exhibit, putting the card on terminals with card readers, he/she is updated on the successive changes of the child history. At the end of the tour, the ultimate fate of the child is revealed.</p>
            <p>This site allows to try how the system works, and its code on GitHub<strong>####PENDIENTE</strong> (free of rights) can help different Holocaust Museums worldwide to implement it (if authorized by the Museum of Tolerance). As a minimum, I will be contacting the Buenos Aires Holocaust Museum to let them know the availability of this demo and material.</p>
            <p>This system was shown on the movie "Freedom writers" (2007). <a href = '{{film_fragment_on_gdrive}}'>The relevant fragment of this film can be seen here.</a></p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Museum of Tolerance (a Simon Wiesenthal Center) located on Los Angeles, USA, has a card system that allows every person to follow the story of a Jew child along the visit to the Holocaust themed exhibit. </p>
            <p>There is a seventy minute dramatic presentation that takes visitors back to the period between 1920s and 1945 in Nazi-dominated Europe.</p>
            <p><strong>Each visitor receives a photo passport card with the story of a child living during the Holocaust.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>As visitors explore different areas,</strong> such as a recreation of a Berlin Outdoor Caf√© and a specially designed Hall of Testimony, <strong>the passport cards keep updating with the drastic changes in the children's lives.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>At the end of the tour, the ultimate fate of the child is revealed.</strong></p>
            <p>The texts (and the child photo) for Cary Krell, included as main example on this demo, were taken from the Tolerance Museum site (<a href='http://www.museumoftolerance.com/education/teacher-resources/holocaust-resources/children-of-the-holocaust/cary-krell.html'>http://www.museumoftolerance.com/education/teacher-resources/holocaust-resources/children-of-the-holocaust/cary-krell.html</a>).</p>
            <p>Most photographs are taken from the "Freedom writers" film.</p>

            <p>At the end of the tour, the card is inserted for a last time (and maybe retained by the machine), and the final stage of the child life is shown, revealing whether he survived or not, and the complete story is printed on a nearby printer so the visitor can re-read in detail the story and take it with him.</p>

The software required is any browser and a Internet connection (or just connection to a local server: a PC). The picture and text size on the templates must be adjusted beforehand to fit in a single screen on the actual terminal.</p>
